    <title>The Super Fun Introduction To Camren!</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Getting To Know Camren Swanson!</h1>
<h2>A brief introduction.</h2>
<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>My name is Camren Swanson, yes that is how my first name is spelt by the way. I am a 21 year old male from crystal lake. I am attending MCC for my second year now, I started in the fall of 2021 and now im officially on my second year, ive came to this school to obtain my associates degree in general studies but now im aiming for my certificate in computer skills. I decided to go for two degrees to give myself multiple outcomes after collage is done and over with, because you never know what the future holds.</p>
<h2>My Hobbies</h2>
<h3>Art!</h3>
<p>One of my hobbies is being creative and doing art, I really like art and its been a hobby of mine since I was a kid id like to say. Some of my art tactics include painting for the most part, but I also do like doing art sketches as well, just little doodles when I get bored. Some of my favorite ways to paint include regular canvas painting, fabric painting, and glass painting, fabric painting being my favorite of course because I like the aspect of being able to make my own designs on clothing for the most part.
<h3>Walks!</h3>
<p>Another hobby of mine is getting to explore the outside world by going on fun and time consuming walks. Usually every morning I like to start my day walking around my neighborhood to wake up and stuff and ill usually walk to the beach right next to my house and hangout there for a bit, and then typically take the long way home by going through other neighborhoods just leading to mine, i like to make the most of my time. Walking around my area isn't all I do, ill even go for super long walks to other places in my city, since I cant drive at the moment I gotta get places somehow, its nothing a walk cant handle, I don't even mind either. Now of course when i do these walks I of course always bring my headphones and listen to some music to keep me slightly entertained!</p>
