    <!--Add a paragraph describing what you are going to review. This should be 2-3 sentences -->
    <p>Im going to be reviewing one of my all time favorite shows called "The Office". This show is about a documentary being filmed about the daily life of the american workforce at a paper company. I am reviewing this show because I feel this is a show that deserves to be reviewed on, its not only a really funny show but it has a great line of characters and a really nice story overall.</p>
    <!--Add a H2 tag describing characters, game play, or some specific part of your review-->
    <h2><b>Michael Scott.</b></h2>
    <!--Add a paragraph about whatever your H2 tag was-->
    <p>Michael Scott is the biggest protagonist of the show, he is the regional manager for the branch and I would say he is the funniest and the best character of the show. In the show some of the other characters would think he is pretty annoying and not so much professional of a manager. However in the end he is the best manager and friend anyone could have, theres been a few times where michael wasn't present and times have been tough and then thats where they realize hes needed the most and means a lot to everyone. (SPOILER ALERT) Michael leaves the office to live with the woman of his dreams and everyone becomes really upset hes leaving and makes his last few days the best workdays of his life, they even throw him a huge going away song to show how much he means to them, then on the last episode he comes back to attend a wedding because he knows how much he means to one of th office workers. I love michael not only for being the funniest character in the show, but mainly because of how important he is to everyone in not just the office but the entire show and the cast itself. </p>
    <!--Add an H3 tag about a scene or character, include a quote in the paragraph-->
    <h3>The Proposal</h3>
    <p>There are two main characters in the show, <b>Jim and Pam</b>, at first they are best friends in the office and Jim has very strong feelings for Pam, but eventually they actually end up dating after some feelings come out, in Jim's words <strong>"Im in love with you"</strong> now yes its not a huge thing to say but it has a lot of meaning because once he said that is when everything for them officially begins, and Pam really realizes her feelings. Pam ends her engagement with her fiance once she learns about Jim's feelings and Jim still thinks about Pam after everything thats going on especially with being with someone else, but he breaks up with her and goes straight to Pam because he knows exactly what he wants. Eventually Pam goes to art school and is gone for a while, and Jim misses her a lot and doesn't know when he'll see her again, so he goes straight for it and meets her halfway and proposes on the spot. This scene meant a lot to the show because their the couple that should have been dating from the very start of the show. From then on afterwards they are a married couple who eventually have children and build a family. </p>
